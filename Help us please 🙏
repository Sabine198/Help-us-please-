I now dad it doesn't belong here but maybe you can help

hello i'm sabine mom of 4 sons.

our story .

we bought a house last year where we do almost all the work ourselves, we looked for and found a contractor for the roof and we thought we had found someone reliable. But apart from the fact that he kept moving the start date, we now know came that he filed for bankruptcy 2 months ago.

so we had given advances to be able to buy his material, but that didn't happen.

result that we lost $ 22000. and that was our own money that we could invest but now that we lost that there is a chance that we have to sell our house.

That's why I'm asking for help to keep and finish our home.

i am very grateful to you and believe that god will help me and help my baby cat's save our, house.ðŸ˜º
